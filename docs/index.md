# Project Thalassa

Welcome to **Project Thalassa**, a cutting-edge bioinformatics data analysis platform designed for SRS (Shotgun Random Sequencing) risk assessment. Built with FastAPI and modern Python tooling, Thalassa provides a robust, scalable solution for processing and analyzing genomic data.

## Overview

Project Thalassa enables partners to:

- **Upload** genomic sequence data securely
- **Analyze** data for risk assessment using advanced bioinformatics algorithms
- **Access** results through an intuitive dashboard
- **Monitor** risk scores with real-time alerts

## Key Features

- **🚀 Fast API**: Built with FastAPI for high-performance async operations
- **📊 Risk Assessment**: Advanced algorithms for SRS risk scoring
- **🔒 Secure**: Enterprise-grade security for sensitive genomic data
- **📱 Interactive**: Auto-generated API documentation with OpenAPI
- **🐳 Containerized**: Docker-ready for easy deployment
- **🧪 Well-Tested**: Comprehensive test suite with pytest

## Architecture

The platform follows a modular architecture:

- **Web API Layer**: FastAPI-based REST API
- **Business Logic**: Modular services for data processing
- **Data Models**: Pydantic schemas for type safety
- **Storage**: Configurable file storage for uploads and results

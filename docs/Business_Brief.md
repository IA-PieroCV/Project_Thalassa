_Generated on: August 9, 2025_
_Status: Validated (Green Light)_

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1. Project Vision

_To create a future where aquaculture is free from preventative antibiotics, ensuring global food security and environmental sustainability through predictive, data-driven biology._

### 1.2. Elevator Pitch

_Project Thalassa is an AI-powered intelligence platform that analyzes the microbiome of farmed salmon to predict disease outbreaks before they happen, empowering producers to replace costly, reactive antibiotic treatments with proactive, targeted interventions._

## 2. Problem & Market Analysis

### 2.1. Problem Statement

_The multi-billion dollar Chilean salmon industry faces an existential crisis due to its reliance on antibiotics to combat Salmonid Rickettsial Septicaemia (SRS). This reactive approach leads to significant stock mortality, high treatment costs, and, most critically, restricted access to premium global markets due to intense pressure from retailers and consumers demanding antibiotic-free products. The industry currently lacks the tools to predict outbreaks, leaving them in a costly and unsustainable cycle of reaction and treatment._

### 2.2. Target Audience

_Our initial customer is the **Head of Fish Health or Chief Sustainability Officer at a top-tier, vertically integrated salmon producer in Chile** (e.g., Mowi, Cermaq, Salmones Camanchaca). This persona manages biological assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars, is scientifically literate, and is under direct executive and market pressure to meet aggressive antibiotic reduction targets. They are data-driven but need new tools to move from reactive to proactive health management._

### 2.3. Market & Competitor Analysis Summary

_The market is the Chilean salmon industry, a global leader with an acute, well-funded problem. Our primary competition is not another software company, but the **status quo**: a deeply entrenched but failing strategy of reactive antibiotic use. Secondary competitors are the large animal health and nutrition companies (e.g., Cargill, dsm-firmenich) who sell individual products (vaccines, additives). Our strategic position is as a neutral, overarching **"Intelligence Platform,"** providing unbiased data on what interventions work, thereby turning potential competitors into components of our recommended solutions._

## 3. The Solution & Value Proposition

### 3.1. Core Solution

_The Thalassa Platform is a SaaS product providing "Microbiome Intelligence as a Service." The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will deliver:_

1.  **Data Ingestion & Baseline:** A secure portal for uploading `fastq` sequencing data from non-invasive fecal samples and establishing a unique "health baseline" for each sea cage.
2.  **Predictive Analytics Engine:** A proprietary AI model that analyzes temporal shifts in the microbiome to generate a real-time **"SRS Outbreak Risk Score"** for each asset.
3.  **Actionable Alerting Dashboard:** A simple UI displaying the risk score for each cage on a map, with automated alerts sent to health managers when a risk score crosses a critical threshold.
4.  **Prescriptive Recommendations:** When an alert is triggered, the platform will suggest specific, non-antibiotic interventions (e.g., deploying a specific probiotic feed) to re-establish a healthy microbial balance.
5.  **ROI Reporting:** Automated reports quantifying the impact of the service on key metrics like mortality rates, FCR, and, most importantly, grams of antibiotics used per ton of fish produced.

### 3.2. Unique Value Proposition (UVP)

_Project Thalassa replaces reactive, costly antibiotic treatments with proactive, data-driven foresight. We empower salmon producers to prevent disease outbreaks, secure access to premium markets, and protect their bottom line._

## 4. Strategy for Success

### 4.1. Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) - First 12 Months

_The primary goal is to achieve product-market fit and scientific validation through a landmark pilot study._

- **Objective 1:** Prove the Thalassa platform's value in a real-world commercial environment.
      _ **KR1:** Secure a formal pilot partnership with a "Top 5 'First Pilot' Partner Candidate" (e.g., The Pincoy Project, Mowi, or Cermaq).
      _ **KR2:** In the pilot, demonstrate a statistically significant correlation between our SRS Risk Score and clinical health outcomes.
      \* **KR3:** Help our pilot partner achieve a measurable reduction in antibiotic use in the monitored cages compared to control groups.

### 4.2. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

_The core metrics to be tracked continuously to monitor product health and impact:_

- Predictive Accuracy of the AI model (e.g., AUC-ROC score).
- Partner Antibiotic Usage Rate (g/tonne).
- Mortality Rate (%) & Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR) in monitored cages.
- Platform Engagement: Weekly Active Users (WAU).
- Customer Churn Rate (post-pilot).

## 5. Risks & Considerations

### 5.1. Key Assumptions & Risks

- **Assumption (Validated):** A predictive signal for SRS exists within the salmon gut microbiome, and the industry is actively seeking non-antibiotic solutions.
- **Primary Technical Risk:** The predictive model's accuracy could be challenged by confounding variables (host genetics, farm-specific antibiotic history).
  - **Mitigation:** The platform's architecture will be designed to incorporate this data as key inputs. The pilot strategy will pursue a "tripartite" model (Thalassa + Producer + INCAR) for rigorous scientific validation.
- **Primary Market Risk:** Gaining the trust and overcoming the inertia of large, conservative producers can lead to long sales cycles.
  - **Mitigation:** Bypass individual sales by targeting an innovative consortium like **The Pincoy Project** first. A successful case study with this group will provide immense credibility and dramatically shorten future sales cycles.

### 5.2. Pivot History

_The project initially focused on FCR optimization in broiler chickens. It was decisively pivoted based on market research revealing a significantly stronger, more acute, and more valuable market need in Chilean salmon aquaculture for predictive disease management and antibiotic reduction._
